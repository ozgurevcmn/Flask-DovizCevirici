# Currency Converter Web Application

This Flask web application allows users to convert currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from the Fixer.io API. Users can specify the amount, the currency they want to convert from, and the currency they want to convert to. The application then calculates the conversion based on the provided inputs and displays the result to the user.

## Features:
- Convert currencies in real-time using up-to-date exchange rates.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive form inputs.
- Utilizes Flask for backend logic and routing.
- Retrieves exchange rates from the Fixer.io API.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
